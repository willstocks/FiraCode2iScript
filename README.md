# FiraCode2iScript
A mish-mash of FiraCode v2 and iScript

I was originally using https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript, however it hasn't been updated in a while and [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) has had a fairly significant update since with some amazing new ligatures.

Really simple to install - download the three `.ttf` files and install them on your system. 

Then, in whatever code editor, just apply `Fira Code 2 iScript` as your font family.

In VSCode, I use (with fallbacks for multiple machines): 

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code 2 iScript, FiraCode-Retina, Fira Code Retina, Fira Code, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
```
